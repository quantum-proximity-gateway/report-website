                      BLE was selected as the primary technology after careful consideration due to its optimal balance of cost-effectiveness, power efficiency, and broad compatibility. BLE signals provide an adequate range and signal strength variations, enabling accurate detection of a user's presence near a specific device. The ESP32 microcontroller, recognized for its affordable and efficient BLE functionality, will serve as the primary BLE beacon. When paired with a Raspberry Pi, this system can analyze signal strength variations and infer directionality, allowing for precise proximity-based authentication.

                      NFC, although a good consideration for authentication, was rejected after a thorough analysis of our requirements indicated that it was not the best fit for our project. Given that our primary objective is to develop a seamless, proximity-based login system that is both secure and accessible, NFC's inherent limitations would hinder our ability to achieve this goal since it requires users to bring an NFC-enabled card or device into close contact of a reader to complete authentication. While this provides a high level of security by requiring intentional user interaction, it does not align with our vision of seamless authentication where users can be automatically detected as they approach a device. These constraints make NFC less practical for our intended application compared to BLE.

                      RFID was also explored as a potential alternative due to its ability to facilitate short-range authentication via electromagnetic fields. This technology operates by having a reader transmit a radio signal that activates passive RFID tags, enabling secure identification. Unlike BLE, RFID tags do not require a power source, making them highly efficient for authentication applications. However, RFID is primarily intended for close-range authentication, typically within just a few centimetres, which does not align with our need for seamless proximity detection across a workspace. Additionally, implementing RFID on a large scale would also necessitate deploying dedicated RFID readers in every interaction zone, significantly increasing both cost and complexity.

                      WPS was another alternative considered, leveraging signal strength (RSSI), triangulation, and fingerprinting to estimate a user's location relative to a device. One notable advantage of Wi-Fi is that it does not require additional hardware, as modern buildings are already equipped with Wi-Fi infrastructure, and most devices support Wi-Fi connectivity. However, WPS is considerably less precise than BLE, and varies greatly depending on interference and network conditions. Another significant drawback is power consumption: Wi-Fi scanning requires substantially more energy than BLE, making it impractical for low-power IoT devices like the ESP32.

              Choosing the right hardware for proximity detection and facial recognition was essential to ensuring reliability and efficiency in our system. After considering several options, we selected the Raspberry Pi 5 as the primary processing unit for facial recognition, and proximity management, whilst the ESP32 microcontroller is used to function as a low-power BLE beacon.

              The Raspberry Pi 5 offers ample processing power to handle incoming BLE signals, run facial recognition algorithms, and communicate with our main server. Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi Camera Module enables us to capture high definition video which is used in the facial recogntion algorithms. Whilst more advanced alternatives like NVIDIA's Jetson Nano provide superior AI capabilities, they come at a higher cost and exceed the requirements of our project. The Raspberry Pi 5 strikes a balance between performance and affordability.

              Meanwhile, the ESP32 was chosen for our low-power BLE beacon due to its cost-effectiveness, and efficiency in sending out BLE signals. It continuously broadcasts signals so that it can be detected by our Raspberry Pi 5, facilitating proximity detection. Whilst a Raspberry Pi Pico for example could also serve as a BLE beacon, we opted for the ESP32 due to our prior experience with the platform, and due to it being more established within the IoT community. By integrating the ESP32 with the Raspberry Pi 5, our system achieves an optimal balance of performance and cost to detect the presence and proximity of our users.

                    For our main server that manages user profiles, Python was chosen as the core language due to its simplicity and extensive library ecosystem. The Litestar framework was used to develop the API endpoints on our server. It was chosen over other renowned frameworks such as Flask or Django due to being asynchronous, highly performant, and lightweight out of the box. Whilst there are more mature, tested frameworks such as Spring for Java, its verbosity and slower development cycle makes it less suitable for rapid prototyping. Moreover, Python bindings for liboqs were available and easy to use allowing us to implement post-quantum encryption without much friction.

                    C++ was chosen to program the ESP32 microcontroller to handle the constant BLE broadcasting, as it is highly performant, and enables low-level hardware control and efficient memory management. This is is crucial for real-time processing on constrained devices. Furthermore, C++ has a mature toolchain, and good support for the Arduino framework, and BLE libraries. Additionally, PlatformIO is used for ESP32 firmware management, streamlining development, debugging, and deployment.

              Ultimately, BLE offers the best combination of affordability, efficiency, and compatibility, making it the ideal choice for enabling seamless, profile-based authentication across multiple devices in real-world environments. For these reasons, we have chosen BLE as the core technology for proximity detection in our QPG system.

                      BLE was selected as the primary technology after careful consideration due to its optimal balance of cost-effectiveness, power efficiency, and broad compatibility. BLE signals provide an adequate range and signal strength variations, enabling accurate detection of a user's presence near a specific device. The ESP32 microcontroller, recognized for its affordable and efficient BLE functionality, will serve as the primary BLE beacon. When paired with a Raspberry Pi, this system can analyze signal strength variations and infer directionality, allowing for precise proximity-based authentication.

                      NFC, although a good consideration for authentication, was rejected after a thorough analysis of our requirements indicated that it was not the best fit for our project. Given that our primary objective is to develop a seamless, proximity-based login system that is both secure and accessible, NFC's inherent limitations would hinder our ability to achieve this goal since it requires users to bring an NFC-enabled card or device into close contact of a reader to complete authentication. While this provides a high level of security by requiring intentional user interaction, it does not align with our vision of seamless authentication where users can be automatically detected as they approach a device. These constraints make NFC less practical for our intended application compared to BLE.

                      RFID was also explored as a potential alternative due to its ability to facilitate short-range authentication via electromagnetic fields. This technology operates by having a reader transmit a radio signal that activates passive RFID tags, enabling secure identification. Unlike BLE, RFID tags do not require a power source, making them highly efficient for authentication applications. However, RFID is primarily intended for close-range authentication, typically within just a few centimetres, which does not align with our need for seamless proximity detection across a workspace. Additionally, implementing RFID on a large scale would also necessitate deploying dedicated RFID readers in every interaction zone, significantly increasing both cost and complexity.

                      WPS was another alternative considered, leveraging signal strength (RSSI), triangulation, and fingerprinting to estimate a user's location relative to a device. One notable advantage of Wi-Fi is that it does not require additional hardware, as modern buildings are already equipped with Wi-Fi infrastructure, and most devices support Wi-Fi connectivity. However, WPS is considerably less precise than BLE, and varies greatly depending on interference and network conditions. Another significant drawback is power consumption: Wi-Fi scanning requires substantially more energy than BLE, making it impractical for low-power IoT devices like the ESP32.

              The development of our QPG system involved multiple programming languages to optimise performance across different components.

            <p className="text-lg my-6">
              Python 3.11 serves as the primary backend language due to its extensive ecosystem of libraries and ease of integration with machine learning, cryptography, and IoT frameworks. We used Python for implementing facial recognition, managing BLE proximity detection, and handling API communication. The flexibility of Python enables rapid development while maintaining a high level of security.

            <p className="text-lg my-6">
              C++ was used for programming the ESP32 microcontroller, specifically handling BLE communication and cryptographic operations. C++ was chosen due to its low-level hardware control capabilities and high performance, which are essential for real-time data processing on constrained devices. The BLE beaconing functionality and cryptographic token generation occur in C++, ensuring efficient device-to-device communication.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg my-6">
              We used TypeScript for the frontend web application, primarily in the registration interface. TypeScript provides a structured approach to JavaScript development, offering type safety and enhanced maintainability. By using TypeScript with Next.js, the frontend ensures a modern and responsive user experience while maintaining security best practices.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg my-6">
              Several other languages were considered but we decided against them due to various limitations. We considered using Java for backend development, but its verbosity and slower development cycle made it less suitable for rapid prototyping and integration with modern AI and cryptographic libraries. Rust was another candidate due to its memory safety and performance benefits, however its ecosystem lacks mature libraries for machine learning and IoT applications, making it less practical for our use case.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg my-6">
              To streamline development, we researched and integrated several frameworks and libraries for our project, including Litestar (explain why this was chosen over something like Flask) for backend APIs, Next.js for frontend development, and PlatformIO for ESP32 firmware management. Secure encryption is ensured through cryptography and liboqs-python, and BLE communication is managed via bluepy. RESTful APIs also facilitate secure data exchange between system components, ensuring real-time authentication and device communication.

              Selecting the appropriate hardware for proximity detection and facial recognition was crucial for ensuring our system's reliability and efficiency. We chose the Raspberry Pi 5 as the primary device for processing facial recognition and managing BLE connectivity, while the ESP32 microcontroller serves as a low-power BLE beacon.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg my-6">
              The Raspberry Pi 5 provides sufficient processing power to run lightweight AI models, making it suitable for on-device authentication within our system. It supports multiple extensions, including the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, which is essential for real-time facial recognition. While alternatives like NVIDIA's Jetson Nano offer superior AI processing capabilities, they are significantly more expensive and somewhat unnecessary for the scope of our project. On the other hand, the ESP32 was selected for proximity detection due to its affordability and efficiency in handling BLE signals. By using a combination of Raspberry Pi 5 and ESP32, our system achieves a balance between computational power, cost-effectiveness, and real-time processing.

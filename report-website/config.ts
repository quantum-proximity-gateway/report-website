export const BASE_PATH = "/";

// export const BASE_PATH = "/2024/group10/";

// !!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!
// In the static out/ folder you MUST CORRECT the BASE_PATH value before _next/ in all src links. By default the base path is / (/_next/).
// In VS Code, open the out/ folder, do Ctrl-Shift-F, and replace all instances of /_next/ with your adjusted path, i.e. /2024/group10/_next/
